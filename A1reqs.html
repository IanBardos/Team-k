  <h1>Introduction</h1>    

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The client is the instructor for COMP2005 course at the Computer
         Science        
         Department, Memorial University of Newfoundland</p>
    <p>The project description presented by the client is as follows:
        <blockquote>The COMP2005 course involves use of tools and environments  
        which students have to &quot;pick-up&quot; along the way, with limited instruction.
        This presents a challenge for students at different levels of
        experience with software development. I would like them to have a 
        collaborative tool for exchanging information on materials, tutorials, 
        tools, organization and other helpful resources or links. It should be 
        along the lines of other software development forums such as Stack 
        Overflow. </blockquote> </p>
    <p>The project team is a group of up to 5 students registered in COMP2005 
        for the Winter 2018 semester. </p>
    <p>   

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Accepted techniques for requirements gathering include:
            <ul>
                <li>Client interview</li>
                <li>User group dicussion</li>
                <li>User stories</li>
                <li>UML use case analysis</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>In their first assignment, each student is tasked with applying a   
         selection of techniques and producing three possible requirements for 
         this project.  At least 
         one of the three requirements produced is to be original and added to 
         the requirements list in this document. 

       <h3>Documentation</h3>

        <h4>Requirements list HTML tags and conventions</h4>
            <p>HTML tags, attributes, and styles have been defined for the 
                Requirements List section of this document as follows: 
            <ul>
                <li>CSS styling of the requirements list is maintained in the file &quot;requirements.css&quot;. 
                    To change the list appearance, modify the CSS file. </li> 
                <li>the <code>rqlist</code> CSS class identifies a 
                    requirements list &lt;ol&gt; tag</li>
                <li>Each requirement is a list item using an &lt;li&gt; tag</li>
                <li>Each requirement list item has a <code>data-moscow</code>
                    attribute identifying its MOSCOW priority class &lt;li data-moscow=m&gt;</li>
                <li>Each requirement starts with a short imperative statement in 
                    present tense and active voice that captures the intent of the requirement. </li> 
                <li>A fuller description of the requirement is included following the short statement.
                      The description may contain concerns and issues that are unresolved or other commentary.
                      The description is classed <code>rqdesc</code> with a &lt;p class=rqdesc&gt; tag</li>
                <li>A requirement data element follows the short statement. 
                    This data includes the requirment author&#39;s login id and the date and time the 
                    requirement was submitted
                      This paragraph is classed <code>rqdata</code> with a &lt;p class=rqdata&gt; tag</li>
                <li>A requirement validation element follows the requirement data element. 
                    This element references the methods and documents used to validate the requirements. 
                    Explanation of validity and links to other media files such as use case analyses 
                    should be supplied. 
                      This paragraph is classed <code>rqvali</code> with a &lt;p class=rqvali&gt; tag</li>
                <li>A requirement verfication plan element follows the requirement data element. 
                    This element references the methods and documents used to validate the requirements. 
                    Links to other media files such as use case analyses are encouraged. 
                      This paragraph is classed <code>rqveri</code> with a &lt;p class=rqveri&gt; tag</li>
                <li>A requirement may contain a &lt;ol&gt; tagged sub-list of requirements. 
                    In this case, the list item may be a title for a sub-category of requirements and may
                    or may not be a requirement itself.
                    If the item is a simple category title and not a requirement, it will not have 
                    a <code>data-moscow</code> attribute and it will not contain any paragraph 
                    tagged details.</li>
             </ul>
